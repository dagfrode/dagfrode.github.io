### 50

- Read up on github branch protection rules, and [github actions security](https://www.wiz.io/blog/github-actions-security-guide) [Bypass github branch protection with actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbfhVXJn6fk&pp=ygUmYnlwYXNzIGJyYW5jaCBwcm90ZWN0aW9uIGdpdGh1YiBhY3Rpb24%3D)
- [So Long, and Thanks for All the Phish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ4tG7nRUyU). Talk about how one of the worlds larges phishing attacs where organiced and how it worked. [More about it from Norwegian national media](https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/jakten-pa-darcula-1.17337596)
- Been reading up on browser versions. Interesting to know that iOS Safari 15.8 is years newer than iOS Safari 16.0-3 and the featureset is likevise.
- Been looking into [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/docs/tutorials/building-a-client-node/). And [MCP:UI](https://mcpui.dev/). Servers for providing AI developer tools with tools for interacting with services. MCP:UI beeing UI focused giving LLM's access to insert UI elements into their chat and MCP servers beeing more of a api integration.

### 49

- Been looking into colors and color spaces. [sRGB is only one of multiple HSL and OKLCH beeing alternatives](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl). OKLCH gives you the benefit of beeing able to make color scales better as it has light and chrome(color intensity) as seperate parameters allowing you to change the brigthness off a color in a way that feels more even to the eye than SRGB.
- Been looking into and using more advanced features of github actions. Not nessessarrely anything gamechanging, but have worked more with it as to get to a point I feel like I understand the basics well.

## November

### Week 48

### Week 21

- tested out decap git cms by Netlify. It looks nice but the documentation is hard to follow and i had to read trought lots of different pages to get a working basic example. Also some features are beta and is shown in the example app but did not work when I used their latest version from CDN. Looks promesing appart from that and could se myself using it if the nested pages feature that is in beta actually worked.
- Tested out Payload CMS a tiny bit. Just got it up and running. Seem nice so far. Just kinda gives you a whole website to start out with and modify. Reminds me a bit of something between wordpress and Django. Look forward to exploring it a bit more.
- started slightly reading up on CDNs. Will have to read up a whole lot more.
- Been trying to fix the 3D print this week. No amount of print head cleaning did the trick so tried replacing the print head, but the electronics where stuck so ended up having to order a whole new print head asembly. Got up and working nicely after. Print stuff for aliminium profiles to be used in rigging in tv production.
