Hi there Derek,

I'm Dag Frode, a 30 year old software developer currently residing in Oslo, Norway. Got thinking about you as I was watching 8 out of 10 cats and one of the comedians reminded me of you. So I have spent the past half hour setting up a /now page. Got to know you from Tim.

Something about me, hm, well, I've been a scout for 20 years on and of, enjoying spending time outdoors and seeing kids grow and become more independent. I did pole dancing for 3 years, even got to preform in front of hundreds of people as part of a student show at "Studentersamfundet i Trondheim", a place I highly recommend visiting if you ever find yourself in Trondheim. I greatly enjoy reading, currently rereading a lot of sci-fi, Murderbot diaries, Bobiverse. And Cal Newports Slow productivity. 

Currently enjoying a week of between work. Trying to find a workplace that fits better, hoping what I'm going to next week will fit well. In general trying to optimize for energy and figuring out what gives energy and gets me excited and how to turn that into creative projects without getting overwhelmed by the amount of work or possibilities or stuck on some details and feeling like the current is pushing me into a rock.

I'm also working on updating my website https://dagfrode.com/ moving some feature and articles from my old one https://dagfs.dev/ . Trying to find my form and purpose in having a website, even tough it was what got me into programming 15 years ago. There has been quite a lot of side quests since then.

Oh, and I like creating things that make people feel things, and being a bit rebellious in all sorts of different ways, it gets people excited. Most of my project start out with a feeling I want to create, or maybe share. I get a feeling when thinking about the idea then try to make it into something so others get to experience the feeling I'm having. Might be connected to experiences of feeling excited about some weird idea or trivia and wanting someone to share that feeling with me, but not being able to communicate it well enough, or the other person not having the concepts lined up in a way that trigger this glee in me, the same sort of glee you get to see on babies being stimulated multiple ways at once.

I think the thing that resonated very well with me from reading different parts of your page today, was reading about wanting to work long stretches by yourself. I spend 10 days walking 130km last year by myself, and enjoyed it greatly. I thought I would have to deal a lot with my own thoughts, but it ended up being surprisingly still for the first 8 days. Just keep walking to up a lot of head space, and only the last few days when returning to society were around the corner and the walking distance grew shorter did the thoughts come. I'll pick up on some notes I wrote after the hike tomorrow.

Thank you for sharing your ideas, and your time reading this, and for being a mentor to me in letting me collect my thoughts and answer some of my own questions while writing this to you. I'm saving this so I can read through and pick up on some of the things I identifying writing this.

Experience bliss trough the perfect imperfections in life, where concept meets form and becomes reality.

All the best
Dag Frode Solberg
