# Building Knowledge and Empathy for Accessibility through Educational Games

Over the past decades, there has been significant progress in digital accessibility, driven by better tools, stronger governance, and increased awareness. However, shifting economic priorities and limited understanding of accessibility concepts threaten to stall this progress. For many developers, accessibility remains a vague and complex area — a checklist of standards without a clear sense of how to meet them or why they matter.

Accessibility is a broad field, encompassing diverse types of impairments — from visual and auditory impairments to motor limitations and cognitive challenges. Importantly, these impairments may be permanent, temporary (e.g., an injury), or situational (e.g., a noisy environment or glare on a screen). By designing with accessibility in mind, we improve digital experiences not just for those with disabilities, but for everyone.

This project examines how interactive and educational games can be utilized to promote empathy and understanding of accessibility challenges. The idea is to simulate different impairments through playable web-based scenarios that highlight common accessibility failures. Players will experience the frustrations faced by users with impairments and then be guided through the process of improving the design, seeing firsthand how the same content becomes more usable and inclusive.

Possible contributions of the project include:

- Designing and implementing an accessibility-focused learning game
- Simulating impairments such as blindness, color blindness, dyslexia, or motor impairments
- Demonstrating common accessibility barriers in websites and showing how to fix them
- Evaluating learning outcomes or user experiences with a prototype

This project is ideal for students interested in inclusive design, human-computer interaction, educational technology, or web development. It offers a chance to combine technical work with a meaningful social mission.
