> "You can be compliant with WCAG but still have a webpage that is not accessible to most people."

Web accessibility isn't just about following rules—it's about understanding how real people experience the web and building things that work for everyone.

## Why This Matters

Around 15-20% of the population has some form of disability. That's not just screen reader users—it includes people with motor difficulties who can't use a mouse, people with cognitive differences, colorblindness, temporary injuries, or just someone trying to use a website in bright sunlight.

**Start here:** Spend 2 minutes experiencing what dyslexia feels like: [Dyslexia Simulation](https://geon.github.io/programming/2016/03/03/dsxyliea). This is what accessibility is about—real people struggling with interfaces we take for granted.

## Three Pillars of Sustainable Accessibility

To work with accessibility in a sustainable way—maintaining it over time without it becoming a last-minute checklist—you need three things:

### 1. Education (Opplæring)

Good resources that make it easy to learn and re-learn what's important. Build empathy through experience, not just theory.

### 2. Process (Prosess)

Integrate accessibility throughout development—from design to deployment. Not as a final check, but as part of every step.

### 3. Tools (Verktøy)

Automated testing, linters, screen readers, checklists—tools that support your work and catch issues early.

This guide focuses on **education**. Learn the [system view](./a11y-system.md) to understand how process fits together.

## Learning Path

### 1. [Accessibility Foundations](./a11y-foundations.md)

**Time: 30-45 minutes**

Build empathy and understanding. What is accessibility? Who benefits? Why does it matter?

_Start here if you're new to accessibility._

### 2. [Standards & Guidelines](./a11y-standards.md)

**Time: 30 minutes**

Understand WCAG without getting lost in legal jargon. Learn what actually matters for developers.

_Practical overview of accessibility standards._

### 3. [Semantic HTML](./a11y-semantic-html.md)

**Time: 20 minutes**

The foundation of accessibility. Get this right and you solve 80% of problems before they start.

_Most important topic for quick wins._

### 4. [Keyboard Accessibility](./a11y-keyboard.md)

**Time: 25 minutes**

Millions of people can't use a mouse. Make your interfaces work with keyboards.

_Critical for usability._

### 5. [Screen Readers](./a11y-screen-readers.md)

**Time: 45 minutes**

Demystify screen readers. Learn what they do and how to test with them.

_Eye-opening experience—highly recommended._

### 6. [ARIA](./a11y-aria.md)

**Time: 30 minutes**

When HTML isn't enough. Learn when and how to use ARIA properly.

_Important, but only after you understand HTML._

### 7. [Accessible Forms](./a11y-forms.md)

**Time: 25 minutes**

Forms are everywhere. Make them work for everyone.

_High-impact, everyday skill._

### 8. [Visual Accessibility](./a11y-visual.md)

**Time: 20 minutes**

Color contrast, text scaling, and reducing motion. Make your designs perceivable.

_Affects everyone, not just people with disabilities._

### 9. [Testing](./a11y-testing.md)

**Time: 30 minutes**

Learn how to verify accessibility with automated tools and manual testing.

_Essential for maintaining quality._

### 10. [Modern Frameworks](./a11y-frameworks.md)

**Time: 25 minutes**

Accessibility challenges in React, Vue, and other SPAs.

_For those working with modern frontend._

### 11. [AI-Assisted Accessibility](./a11y-ai.md)

**Time: 20 minutes**

Using AI tools to help build accessible interfaces. Claude skills, agents, and best practices.

_For those using AI to generate code._

## Quick Start: 15 Minutes

Don't have much time? Do this:

1. **Experience it** (2 min): Try the [dyslexia simulation](https://geon.github.io/programming/2016/03/03/dsxyliea)
2. **Feel it** (5 min): Navigate a website using only your keyboard (unplug your mouse!)
3. **Understand it** (8 min): Read [Understanding Accessibility](https://uxdesign.cc/understanding-accessibility-makes-you-a-better-insert-your-name-here-1f7a15c50e7f) about permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities

Now you understand why this matters.

- **Want deeper knowledge?** Each topic page has curated resources
- **Prefer structured learning?** Follow the numbered path above

Remember: Accessibility is a practice, not a destination. Start small, build empathy, and improve with each project.
