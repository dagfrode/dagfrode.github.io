# Board Games with a posibility for adaption to include blind players

July 4th 2025

This document is a work in progress so there will be games listes as potential that has to be explored.

My goal is so identify existing games that can be played by blind players. Games that can easely be adopted and games that require larger modifications to be accessible, all while keeping the game fun for all players.

If you are looking for accessible games for color blindness or visual imparment but not toalt blindness or other facor i reccomend you check out the [Meeple Like Us Masterlist](https://www.meeplelikeus.co.uk/meeple-like-us-masterlist/) that has a quite larg boardgame section they have reviewed for different imparments. I have found that their section for visual imparment does not cover full blindness, this is why I'm creating this page.

It is [estimated 40 to 45 million people are blind and 135 million have low vision](https://www.who.int/news/item/09-10-2003-up-to-45-million-blind-people-globally---and-growing).

I also reccomend checking out [https://sightless.fun/](https://sightless.fun/) even tough it does not seem to be updated anymore. Espessially their [Things To Know When Playing Board Games With Blind People](https://sightless.fun/boardgames/things-to-know-when-playing-board-games-with-blind-players/)

## Games designed for blind players

### [Nyctophobia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/249505/nyctophobia)

One player play as the hunter trying to get the other players while the other players are blindfolded moving trough a maze the hunter can see.

## Games that can be adapted for blind players

Games that can be adopted with minor changes like adding braile to certain items.

### [Team3 Green](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/275870/team3-green)

The player who can see the blueprint can not speak, the player that can not hear interprits and and instructs the player that not see to buidl buildings.

No adoption needed. I put it here as it wil lprobaably be a bit repetetive when you can not change all the roles. Might be more fun with more players.

## Games that can be adapted with bigger modifications for blind players

Games that require larger modification such as custom pieces for the game to work well.

### [Santorini](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini_(game)>)

Working table:

I want to make a table to score the different games and witch to explore first. It will make a final score out of wanting to try the game, combined with how well we think it will be possible to adopt as well as how much effort it will require. We will probably put in quite some effort, but will try lower hanging fruit first.

| Name | Description | BGG rating | Want to try | Adoptability score | Adoptability effort score | total score |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Test | Desc        | 3          | 3           | 3                  | 3                         | 3           |
