Still trying to take things slow. Did not quite manage to do so the past month so been sick for the past few days. Focusing on myself and wedding planning for August 2026 and all that comes with it.

Preparing for hackaton and internal conferance at work. Might be a bad idea, but good way to try to do things slow.
