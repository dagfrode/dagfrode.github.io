Right now I'm trying to take things a bit slow. I've just been at ViteConf in Amsterdam after bringing 20 scouts with me to another country for 5 days. It was a good trip, but a 5 day mindfullness challenge.

I've picked up yoga again and hope to continue doing it for the next few months.

At work I'm rebuilding a design system to modernize it and to make it more user friendly. My workplace is reorganizing, so things are quite chaotic. I'm trying to use AI to generate scripts for me to analyze how our designsystem is used. Something that worked really well for a while but it seem to get worse the longer i try. I might be giving it to challenging data to collect, I'm not sure.

Then there is wedding planning, 3d modeling and printing, mouse fortification of the house and probably a few other project going on at a leasurly pace.

Oh, and I'll pick up Ethan Kross book Shift: Managing Your Emotions--So They Don't Manage You, again

I've not really jornaled nor taken the time to write much in the past year. I'd like to see this update be the reboot of thouse habits.
