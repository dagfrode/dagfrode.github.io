# Manual for working with me

Hi there, pleased to get the pleasure of working with! This is an atemt and communicating how to work best with me.

## First things first

A bit about my personality as per Big-5 and ADEPT-15. I'm only hightlighting facets that are outliers as they tend to be the interesting ones.

There are also a few things that you will probably notice quickly with me that I want to hightlight.

In the work I do, my drive is to solve problems for people and reduce frustration and friction for the people using the software solutions we are working on. This does extend to the other people working on the software in terms of improving devx, processes and frameworks for the work we do to make our work flow better.

### Personality
A quick big 5 based on taking the test every year or so the past few years. Generally wanting to achieve things, dealing with quite a bit of personal stress and uncomfortable feelings, trying to be good to the people I work with and the people affected by the work I do.

### ADEPT-15

- **Drive** - I can be rather focused. I like completing tasks and know that tasks tend to take the time you give them and that quite often it is prefered to get to some level of completion before improving a solution for the sake of the user.
- **Structure** - I did say I would only hightlight my outliers, the thing is, in terms of the big picture vs small picture thinking I would say I'm and outlier in both extremes. I like to go into small details and make sure they are right as they can often cause confution later on. But I also like to look at the big picture and make sure what we are doing makes sence in that regard. So I tend to go a bit back and forth between thouse perspectives. Witch can be a bit confusing as I might end up contradict the point I started making when I started talking as I shift mindset while talking. 
- **Conceptual** - I lean mostly toward practical, with shorter bursts of innovating
- **Flexability** - I'm in general flexible. Until I have made up my mind about what task to do next, then I might need to do a bit of reframing, or simply have a chat with someone to build my motivation with the changed task. Scenarios we talk about in this regard is when we have decided what I should be working on for the rest of the day and half an hour later some other factor changes the demand.
- **Mastery** - My natural state is improving. Figuring out how we can improve devx, reduce busywork, redundant work and in general use less code better. I guess it is a result of writing code for half my life and having spendt my fair share of time doing mundane tasks and wanting to avoid doing them.
- **Ambition** - I'm rather striving. Not quite sure what for. I like to learn, to challenge myself. I find that things in life can be rather scary until you try it once. Once I've tried it a few times it can almost get boring so I keep changing things up to get the feeling of motivation and doing good work.
- **Power** - When we talk about leadership, I tend to think about visionaries. I don't tend to fit that part of leadership, but I would  say I fit moust other parts, I know how to get things done, follow up, and do what the team needs to work well. But I do not have a strong need to feel power in a team setting, it has more to do with wanting to acheve things and challenging myself in new ways. I also enjoy healping others and helping them be their best selfs.
- **Cooperativeness** - I'm very cooporative in most aspects, except while doing the actuall work. I tend to get distracted by others talking and have a hard time articulating what I'm doing as it is just flowing trough me.
- **Sensitivity** - I am rather compassionate striving to be more stoic. 
- **Humility** - I am rather humble. I have done a lot of things I'm proud of and feel like we should be able to be proud of ourselves, but I do not feel like I'm above anyone and most people I have meet have done things I'm impressed by.
- **Composure** - I'm moustly calm. With streaks of passionate when I get overwhelmed.
- **Positivity** - I am rather realistic and know that a lot of things are hard. But the people that work with my experience me as positive and encurraging. 
- **Awareness** - I think I am rather self-aware. I'm activily not devlling to much on things as I've been a rather anxious person and that is to no benefit of anyone.
- **Assertiveness** - I can be rather assertive, when I feel the need, witch for the most part I don't. I try to go by "First listen, then talk."
- **Liveliness** - I'm rather reserved untill I get to know you better. I can be outgoing in short outbursts, but ar rather low on sociability.


### Headsets

The first thing to know about me is that I'm having a hard time working if I hear people talking around me, I need my inner dialog to think, this means I will most likely be wearing a headset when at my desk. I prefer that you send me a short ping on slack so that I can respond if I'm free, need two minutes or if I'm in the middle of something and will get back to you without breaking my flow.


### Sociability

I'm rather introverted in terms of where I get my energy. I therefore prefer small groups of people and have a hard time with large open roms with bad acustics. I get overstimulated. The result might be that I don't join team lunches on days I had a lot of stumulation. I might eat fast and then head out for a walk instead. Feel free to join me tough, I enjoy getting to know the people I work with and socializing in smaller groups!


### Walks

Talking about walks. I have developed a habit of breaking up the day with at least one walk during lunchtime. Feel free to join me. I need the air, sunlight and movement to be at my most productive.

I might need to get out for another walk if the work I'm doing is particularly challeging or if I get overstimulated during the workday. Some work is also easier to get done while walking.


## Workstyle

### Solo vs collaborative
I prefer planning work in colaboration and finding solutions for the work we work on together. When it comes to doing the task I usually prefer working on it by myself then doing peer reviews. I think it has to do with the teams I've worked in previously, so I'm open to try more pair-programming!

### Balancing Creativity and structure
