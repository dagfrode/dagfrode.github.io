# Tools for debugging your mental health



## The circle of control

A common concept among relegions and philosophies.

The concept argues that in life, there are a few things you can controll, a few more you can affect, and a whole lot of things you can care about. The more you focus on what is in your control, the happier you will be as you do not spend your time on futile battles and worry.

The only thing you can really control in life are your actions and your perception of reality. 

The best ebodyment of this concept I have found so far is the seranity prayer.

**Seranity prayer**
>God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
>Courage to change the things I can,
>and Wisdom to know the difference.
> [Seranity prayer - Wikipedia](God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
and Wisdom to know the difference.)


## Just for today - AA
The tools AA use is powerfull, Isugges you read trough [Just for today](https://www.foodaddicts.org/documents/just-for-today-card) and see how it makes you feel. 

The summary is:
- You live your life on day at a time, keep your focus on today and what you can do today.
- Take time by yourself to reflect and relax. Screen time does not count. Go for a walk, be in nature.
- Have a plan for the day, so you do not get overwhelmed by all the things you want to do or can do. Making a schedule lets you figure out what is most important today, and limits how much you try to do in one day.
- Take care of yourself, groom and dress yourself nicely, act agreeable to others, you get what you give out. You can not controll others, only your own actions.
- Be humble to circumstances, there is a lot you do not controll, but you controll your actions and perceptions of life.
- Use your mind by challenging it mentally.
- You choose you you perceive life, so why not choose a perception that makes you happy?
- Do things that are hard and unpleasant. You need to show yourself that you can do it frequently. Try to also do things for others, for your own spiritual wellness.
- live life to the fullest by allowing yourelf to experience and enjoy life.
