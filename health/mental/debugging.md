# Tools for debugging your mental health

## The circle of control

A common concept among relegions and philosophies.

The concept argues that in life, there are a few things you can controll, a few more you can affect, and a whole lot of things you can care about. The more you focus on what is in your control, the happier you will be as you do not spend your time on futile battles and worry.

The only thing you can really control in life are your actions and your perception of reality. 

The best ebodyment of this concept I have found so far is the seranity prayer.

**Seranity prayer**
>God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
>Courage to change the things I can,
>and Wisdom to know the difference.
> [Seranity prayer - Wikipedia](God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
and Wisdom to know the difference.)
