# Tools for debugging your mental health

## The circle of control

A common concept among relegions and philosophies.

The concept argues that in life, there are a few things you can controll, a few more you can affect, and a whole lot of things you can care about. The more you focus on what is in your control, the happier you will be as you do not spend your time on futile battles and worry.

The only thing you can really control in life are your actions and your perception of reality. 

The best ebodyment of this concept I have found so far is the seranity prayer.

**Seranity prayer**
>God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
>Courage to change the things I can,
>and Wisdom to know the difference.
> [Seranity prayer - Wikipedia](God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
and Wisdom to know the difference.)

The summary is:

- Take time by yourself to reflect and relax. Screen time does not count. Go for a walk, be in nature.
- Have a plan for the day, so you do not get overwhelmed by all the things you want to do or can do. Making a schedule lets you figure out what is most important today, and limits how much you try to do in one day.

- Use your mind by challenging it mentally.
- You choose you you perceive life, so why not choose a perception that makes you happy?
