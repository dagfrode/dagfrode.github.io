## Getting into a new job

I stated a new job this week. As an inhouse developer in a pretty big firm. There is lots to get used to and learn about the existing code, and the philosophies the organization folows.




## Setting up this website

I have gooten a good base for this website up and running. Want to introduce some more of the old tools I used ot have like:

- light/dark mode
- Presentation mode
- reading time in top of articles

## Writing CFP

Writing up CFPs for developer confererances. 

Current talk ideas:
- "That not my name; the art of naming things" - why naming things in software is so hard (it's a game of thelephone from experts trough developers to user interfaces), and how to get better at naming things (some simple rules, and some frameworks for documenting and clearifying your domain)
- "Mental health; a systems approach" - looking at mental health by looking at the ourselves as a set of systems and looking at how to take care of yourselves. Sort of a ownsers manual.
- Sustainable accessibility / Accessible CI/CD - For accessibility to be sustainable there must be easy ways to maintain it and clear processes for both automatic and manual testing.
