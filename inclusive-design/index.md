# Accessibility testing

## Automatic tests

### As part of testing

Use a tool like SiteImprove or Wave. There are quite a few other alternatives so have a look around to find what tools you like the best. Some tools even help you with manual testing.

SiteImprove also provides tools for scanning public pages and create a report. This is usefull if your solution is a big website with many involved parties resposible for content and changes that can affect accesability.

### As part of the development process

#### Linting

Adding accessability linting provides a convinient reminder of what you can do to make your solutions more accessible as you write them.

One possible linter is [axe DevToolsÂ® Linter](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/linter/)

#### Automatic tests

There are multiple tools that can be used for accassability testing as part of CI/CD one of the is Playwright

## Manual testing
