The result pyramid is a simple pyramid arguing that what we often end up doing at work, managing peoples actions is not efficent. The most productive way to lead others is by influencing their experiences, wich in turn will affect their believes, that affect their actions and lead to the results you are striving for.

Going straight to managing actions is a lot harder as one often end up working against the established culture and peoples beliefs. 

You acheieve results by affecting peoples experiences in turn changing their believes and actions leading to the results you strive for.
